# Privacy Policy

Last updated: February 6, 2026

Edvibe Sonaveeb Link does not collect, store, or transmit personal data to the developer.

## What the extension does

- Runs only on `edvibe.com` pages.
- Reads the currently displayed training word in the page DOM.
- Requests word forms from `https://api.sonapi.ee/v2/<word>`.
- Builds links to `https://sonaveeb.ee` for dictionary lookup.
- Stores local extension settings (`position`, `disableAutoplay`) in Chrome storage.

## Data handling

- No account creation.
- No analytics.
- No tracking.
- No sale or sharing of user data.

## Third-party services

The extension sends the current word to:
- `api.sonapi.ee` (to fetch forms)
- `sonaveeb.ee` (when user opens dictionary link)

These services are independent and have their own privacy policies.

## Contact

If you need changes to this policy, publish a new version of the extension and update this file/date.
